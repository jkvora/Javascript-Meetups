## Meetup-Talkies
It intends to be repository for finding tech talks held at different cities.

## Motivation

Over a period, I have realized whenever I need to search slides or resource of the tech meetups (mostly Javascript meetups)  held, I generally tend to go through speakers social profiles and scroll till I find it. It really becomes cumbersome when I have to refer slides of talks held many time ago.This repo serves as a simple database of the meetups hosted  grouped by cities.

##  Working and Contributing 
 Run the command ```node index.js``` and  it will ask some questions. It will add the details in a json file and generate a markdown file on its own.Look at the  **meetups** folder and find your tech talk added. Review your changes and a create a pull request.
 
 A simple monolithic json  file is used as database.Anyone can extract it and use it ( simple cases liek filter your own talks etc.) according to your own conveniency.
